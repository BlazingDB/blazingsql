Mining literature on COVID-19
=============================

Coronaviruses have been around for decades but few to none such deadly and easily spreading as the COVID-19 thus far. 
In the 1st half of 2020, Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and a consortium of research institutes along with the 
White House curated a corpus of scientific papers on coronaviruses published since 19th century and offered a Kaggle 
competition to analyze it and answer some questions about different aspects of the virus, like how it spreads, or 
how it affects living organisms.
